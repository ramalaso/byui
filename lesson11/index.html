                What to Do
                Take as many pictures as you can. This site is beautiful, the architecture and style is impressive.

                Things to Buy
                Many indigenous women will be selling pottery, scarves, clothes, crafts and other handmade things. They do not really charge much, and these items are worth it for the price. You'll probably only come here once in your life, so you might want to make sure to buy things you'll have to remember.
